##  Hi, I'm Bhavya!

I'm a passionate Computer Science Engineering student currently pursuing my B.Tech (3rd year) at Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology. I love exploring new technologies, building projects, and solving real-world problems through code.

My interests span across web development, data structures, machine learning, and DevOps. I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new tools to grow as a developer and engineer.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading tech blogs, participating in hackathons, and collaborating on open-source projects.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
